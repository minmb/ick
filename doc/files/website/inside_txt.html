h1. Inside the Invocation Construction Kit
</p>
<p>
h2. More about the four block structures
</p>
<p>
&quot;Ick&quot;:index.html provides let, a method for block-structuring
Ruby code. As already shown, if you want someone&#8216;s phone number only
if they are a friend: @let(Person.find(:first, &#8230;)) { |person|
person.phone_number if person.friend? }@
</p>
<p>
This code makes it clear that you only need the @person@ variable inside
the block. If you want to refactor this code, you know that the entire
expression can move without breaking another piece of code.
</p>
<p>
h3. let, returning, my, and inside
</p>
<p>
As shown above, let does the obvious thing: it passes a value to a block,
it evaluates the block in the caller&#8216;s environment, and it returns
the result of the block. Hmmm&#8230;
</p>
<p>
There are two binary decisions to be made about every block: First, do you
want to evaluate the block in the calling environment (which is how almost
every block is evaluated in Ruby), or do you want to evaluate the block in
the value&#8216;s context. In other words, does <em>self</em> stay the
same, or does it become the value in the block?
</p>
<p>
If you want something that behaves like let but evaluates in the
value&#8216;s environment just like please, you can use my:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; my(Person.find(:first, &#8230;)) do
</p>
<pre>
        first_name = 'Charles'
        last_name = 'Babbage'
        friends &lt;&lt; 'Ada Lovelace'
</pre>
<p>
end &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
This will return Charles Babbage&#8216;s friends. On the surface,
<em>evaluates_in_value_environment</em> is about the syntactic sugar of
dropping an instance variable. But with a little thought, you can come up
with some really cool way to (mis)use this capability.
</p>
<p>
So let and my both pass an expression to a block and return the result.
Given that they both &#8216;declare&#8217; <em>returns_result</em>, this is
not surprising. But there is another choice: <em>returns_value</em> instead
of <em>returns_result</em>. Ruby on Rails includes the popular returning
method, and it works the same in Ick:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; returning(Person.find(:first, &#8230;))
do |p|
</p>
<pre>
        p.first_name = 'Charles'
        p.last_name = 'Babbage'
        p.friends &lt;&lt; 'Ada Lovelace'
</pre>
<p>
end &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
This returns the person record, not the list of friends. The block is
evaluated strictly for side effects. And what happens if we want to return
the value and also evaluate in the value&#8216;s environment?
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; inside(Person.find(:first, &#8230;)) do
</p>
<pre>
        first_name = 'Charles'
        last_name = 'Babbage'
        friends &lt;&lt; 'Ada Lovelace'
</pre>
<p>
end &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
The method inside returns the value and evaluates the block in the
value&#8216;s environment.
</p>
<p>
(The four methods were inspired by &quot;Michiel de Mare&#8216;s&quot;:<a
href="http://blog.rubyenrails.nl/articles/2008/02/18/our-daily-method-10-object-r-rs-ds-s">blog.rubyenrails.nl/articles/2008/02/18/our-daily-method-10-object-r-rs-ds-s</a>
post on the same subject, although Ick’s nomenclature is not compatible
with Michiel’s. Michiel’s rsss, rrss, rsds, and rrds are called
returning, let, inside, and my in Ick.)
</p>
<p>
h3. lets
</p>
<p>
Ick version 0.3 includes an experiemental form of let, lets, that allows
you to bind multiple variables:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; lets(
</p>
<pre>
    :person =&gt; Person.find(:first, ...),
    :place  =&gt; City.select { ... },
    :thing  =&gt; %w(ever loving blue eyed)) {
  &quot;#{person.name} lives in #{place} where he is known as the '#{thing} thing.'&quot;
</pre>
<p>
} &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
You must have the &quot;ruby2ruby gem&quot;:<a
href="http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/ruby2ruby">seattlerb.rubyforge.org/ruby2ruby</a>/
installed to use lets. You know the drill:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre&gt;sudo gem install ruby2ruby&lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
Like let, lets <em>evaluates_in_value_environment</em> and
<em>returns_result</em>. You can roll your own variations if you want
something else. If you&#8216;re familiar with Lisp, lets is a lot like
Lisp&#8216;s simplest let macro. But not like letrec or let*. If you
don&#8216;t know the difference, then lets will not suprise you. Basically,
the binding of values to names works a lot like you would expect a hash to
behave.
</p>
<p>
For example, if I wrote:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; a = nil a = { :foo =&gt;
call_something_else(), :bash =&gt; a[:foo] } &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
You would consider this bad code, wouldn&#8216;t you? There&#8216;s no
expectation that the espressions are evaluated in any particular order.
It&#8216;s the same with lets. This is probably a bad idea:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; foo = nil lets(:foo =&gt;
call_something_else(), :bash =&gt; foo) { &#8230; } &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
@bash@ is not going to be bound to the return value of
@call_something_else@, it&#8216;s going to be bound to nil. The variables
you bind are only visible inside the block.
</p>
<p>
h3. What about try and maybe?
</p>
<p>
The methods try and maybe are both implemented as
<em>evaluates_in_calling_environment</em>, because that is least
surprising. But when you&#8216;re rolling your own, you might want to
change that to make things more sugary. For example, here is a different
version of try:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; class Please &lt; <a
href="../../classes/Ick/Guard.html">Ick::Guard</a>
</p>
<pre>
  guard_with { |value, sym| value.respond_to?(sym) == true }
  evaluates_in_value_environment and returns_result
  belongs_to Object
</pre>
<p>
end
</p>
<p>
please(&#8230;) { may.i.have.some.more } &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
The method please executes in the value&#8216;s environment, and thus it
can call methods directly. Here is the key point about Ick as compared to
rolling your own methods directly: you can combine and recombine the parts
to make new kinds of methods. As you just saw, we can make try and please
out of the same building blocks. This is why Ick is a &quot;contruction
kit,&quot; not just a collection of handy syntactic short cuts.
</p>
<p>
h2. Wrap Music
</p>
<p>
The four methods let, returning, my, and inside are fairly simple.
There&#8216;s some finagling with what they return and their evaluation
environment, but evaluation within the environment is 100% standard Ruby.
But things get really interesting when we want to actually change
Ruby&#8216;s evaluation behaviour. Specifically, when we want to change
what it means to call a method on the value we provide.
</p>
<p>
That&#8216;s what maybe, please, and try all do: when a method is called on
the value, they intercept it and decide whether to call the method or
prematurely return <em>nil</em>. Ick can&#8216;t actually change the
behaviour of the Ruby interpreter, so what it does is as close to evil
metaprogramming as possible. Ick doesn&#8216;t do any method redefinition
or method chain manipulation, instead it performs its juju by wrapping the
value in a delegator. Ick&#8216;s delegators are called <em>Wrappers</em>.
</p>
<p>
Ick&#8216;s built-in methods that use wrappers inherit from @<a
href="../../classes/Ick/Wrap.html">Ick::Wrap</a>@. When the result is
returned from the block, it is unwrapped if it is wrapped.
</p>
<p>
h3. Hand Rolling
</p>
<p>
You can use <a href="../../classes/Ick/Wrap.html">Ick::Wrap</a> along with
your own wrappers by calling invoke_wrapped:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;Ruby&quot;&gt; class MyWrapper &lt; <a
href="../../classes/Ick/Wrapper.html">Ick::Wrapper</a>
</p>
<pre>
  def initialize(value)
    # ...
  end
  # ...
</pre>
<p>
end
</p>
<p>
Ick::Wrap.instance.invoke_wrapped(Person.find(:first, &#8230;), MyWrapper)
&lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
If you need additional parameters for your wrapper, you can declare them in
the initializer and pass them to invoke_wrapped:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;Ruby&quot;&gt; class MyWrapper &lt; <a
href="../../classes/Ick/Wrapper.html">Ick::Wrapper</a>
</p>
<pre>
  def initialize(value, extra1, extra2)
    # ...
  end
  # ...
</pre>
<p>
end
</p>
<p>
Ick::Wrap.instance.invoke_wrapped(Person.find(:first, &#8230;), MyWrapper,
:foo, :bar) &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
The methods maybe, please, and try are all implemented as subclasses of
Ick:Guard. Have a look at guard.rb to see how to hide the extra wrapping
syntax that invoke_wrapped requires.
</p>
<p>
h3. ArrayWrapper
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Ick/ArrayWrapper.html">Ick::ArrayWrapper</a> wraps a
collection of receivers. Any message sent to the wrapper is dispatched to
each of the receivers in the collection. Here&#8216;s a simplified
implementation:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; class ArrayWrapper &lt; Wrapper
</p>
<pre>
  def __invoke__(sym, *args, &amp;block)
    @value.map { |_| _.__send__(sym, *args, &amp;block) }
  end

  is_contagious
</pre>
<p>
end &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
What on Earth is it for? Specifically, what&#8216;s wrong with just using
Enumerable#map if we want to send the same message(s) to each receiver in a
collection?
</p>
<p>
The answer is that when we use Enumerable#map, it executes the entire block
once for each receiver. So if there are side effects in the block, they are
executed once for each receiver as well. Whereas ArrayWrapper dispatches
the messages to each receiver without executing side effects more than
once.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Ick/Tee.html">Ick::Tee</a> provides a method for
using an ArrayWrapper with <em>return_value</em> semantics. When you use
tee, it evaluates the block once, but dispatches methods to each of the
values you pass in. It returns the first value you pass in. This can be
handy for things like sending logging information to more than one log.
</p>
<p>
Here&#8216;s one of the test cases you can find in the gem:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; def test_tee_semantics
</p>
<pre>
  array_logger_one = []
  array_logger_two = []
  line_number = 0
  [array_logger_one, array_logger_two].map do |log|
    line_number += 1
    log &lt;&lt; &quot;A#{line_number}&quot;
    line_number += 1
    log &lt;&lt; &quot;B#{line_number}&quot;
  end
  assert_equal(%w(A1 B2), array_logger_one)
  assert_equal(%w(A3 B4), array_logger_two)
  array_logger_one = []
  array_logger_two = []
  line_number = 0
  tee(array_logger_one, array_logger_two) do |log|
    line_number += 1
    log &lt;&lt; &quot;A#{line_number}&quot;
    line_number += 1
    log &lt;&lt; &quot;B#{line_number}&quot;
  end
  assert_equal(%w(A1 B2), array_logger_one)
  assert_equal(%w(A1 B2), array_logger_two)
</pre>
<p>
end &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
When we used Enumerable#map, the side effect @line_number += 1@ is
evaluated four times, twice for each receiver. However when we use tee, the
side effect @line_number += 1@ is only evaluated twice, even though we have
two receivers. Now that you know about the four execution possibilities
encapsulated by let, returning, my, and inside, you can probably guess what
fork does when I tell you that its implementation <em>returns_result</em>.
</p>
<p>
h3. Beware!
</p>
<p>
Because <a href="../../classes/Ick/Wrap.html">Ick::Wrap</a> is passing a
wrapper into the block instead of the original value, you can get
unexpected results under certain circumstances. For example, if you assign
the value something else within the block such as an instance variable,
when the block exits the value will still have whatever behaviour the
wrapper creates.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, wrappers are <em>unidirectional</em>: they only work when you
are calling methods on your value, not when you are passing the wrapped
value as a parameter to any other method. This is hideous: why should there
be any difference between @{ |value| value + 1 }@ and @{ |value| 1 + value
}@?
</p>
<p>
Also, wrappers are <em>external</em>, they only affect messages sent to the
wrapped value in your block. For example, if you are using try to avoid
NoMethodErrors, any messages you send to the wrapped value will handled by
the wrapper. But what happens if the wrapped value sends itself a message
that it doesn&#8216;t handle? Aha, that will raise a NoMethodError!
</p>
<p>
Wrappers are a very leaky abstraction, which is why I try to name things a
little closer to what they actually do than what they purport to do but
don&#8216;t really do. For example, we write @try { something.or.other }@
to emphasize that we are only trying the things you see in front of you.
</p>
<p>
h2. Why Ick?
</p>
<p>
As just mentioned, Ick is a construction kit. By all means install the gem
and go wild with let, returning, my, inside, try, and maybe. But have a
look under the hood. Ick uses classes and template methods to replicate
what can be done in a few lines of explicit code. For example,
Object#returning is implemented in Rails as:
</p>
<p>
&lt;pre syntax=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt; class Object
</p>
<pre>
  def returning(value)
    yield(value)
    value
  end
</pre>
<p>
end &lt;/pre&gt;
</p>
<p>
So why bother with Ick? Well, if you want to make a method just like
Object#returning, only <em>X</em> (for some value of X), you can&#8216;t do
that without copying, pasting, and modifying. Ick&#8216;s classes are
included specifically so you can subclass things and make your own new
kinds of methods that are variations of the existing methods.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the extra abstraction is appropriate if you want to use the built-in
methods as a starting point for your own exploratory programming. And if
you don&#8216;t care, you just want the methods, by all means install the
gem and just use them. Don&#8216;t worry about the implementation unless
you identify it as a performance problem.
</p>
<p>
h3. Where do you want to go today?
</p>
<p>
The point behind abstracting invocation and evaluation is that you can
_separate concerns_. For example, which methods to chain is one concern.
How to handle nil or an object that does not respond to a method is a
separate concern. Should you raise and handle and exception? Return nil?
log an error? Why should error handling and logging be intermingled with
your code?
</p>
<p>
With Ick, you can separate the two issues. You can even make the handling
pluggable. For example, if instead of calling let you call your own method,
you could sometimes invoke @<a
href="../../classes/Ick/Let.html">Ick::Let</a>@ with a block and other
times invoke your own handler, perhaps one that logs every method called.
</p>
<p>
Have fun!
